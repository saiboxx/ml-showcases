# Anime Face Generator

This little project tries to generate Anime Characters via a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder.
The dataset used for training was taken from [here](https://github.com/Mckinsey666/Anime-Face-Dataset) and contains 65.000 scraped characters.

So far the architecture itself works but it seems that the balance of reconstruction loss and KL-divergence is a bit off, which results in poor image generation.
I will tune hyperparameters in near future to solve this issue.
